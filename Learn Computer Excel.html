    <h2>MICROSOFT EXCEL</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p><ol>
    <li> Microsoft Excel is an advanced electronic spreadsheet used for management and presenting data in an organized form.  It is a tool mostly used for financial planning, calculation works, forecasting and job costing. Excel allows you to enter label description text and numbers.  You can format and perform calculations on numbers using the convention arithmetic function +, -, *, /.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Spreadsheet is a general name given to application software that performs calculations based on rows and columns.  Two examples of Spreadsheet packages are Microsoft Excel and Lotus1-2-3.  Ms Excel application performs financial calculation works, forecasting, draws charts, job costing and many more.  Spreadsheets are displayed in a grid layout.  The letters across the top of Column Headings.  If you look down to the left side of the grid, you will see numbers which start from 1 at the very top and go down to over million.  The exact number of rows and columns are <b>1,048,576 rows </b> and <b>16,384 columns</b>.  Spreadsheets are all about individual cells.  A cell is a Letter combined with a Number.  So, if for instance you combine the B column with row 5, you get cell B5, combine Column D with row 5 you get cell D5.  Click on a cell, you will see a black border. This tells you the cell is active.  The cell that is active will have it’s own column letter top and row number displayed in the top left with the color showing you the address.</li>

<h4>Opening Excel</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Click start button located on the taskbar</li>
    <li>Click all programs </li>
    <li>Locate Microsoft Office Folder and click it</li>
    <li>Locate Microsoft Excel 2007 and click it then Microsoft Excel 2007 and screen is displayed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Excel Worksheet</h4>
<p>This is a set of rows, columns and cells which you store and manipulate Data’s.  it is a sheet of paper that is ruled in Rows, Columns and Cells ready for entries of Data </p>
<h4>Rows</h4>
<p>These are horizontal lines or rulings and they are ruled from the top downwards of the worksheet with Numeric’s (Numbers e.g. 1-10 etc) 18 rows are usually displayed on the screen at a time in Microsoft Excel e.g.</p>
<h4>Columns</h4>
<p>These are vertical lines or rulings which are ruled from the left to the right hand and they are labeled across the worksheet with the letters A – Z.</p>
<h4>Cell</h4>
<p>A cell is the smallest unit of the worksheet or a table, it is an intersection of rows and columns.  Every Data entered into a worksheet sits or goes to a cell.</p>
<h4>Excel Rows and Columns</h4>
<p>Spreadsheets are displayed in a grid layout.  The letters across the top are column headings.  To highlight an entire column click on any of the letters.  Spreadsheets are all about individual cells.  A cell is a letter combines with a number.  So if you combine the  B column with row 5 for instance, you get cell B5, Note that if you click on any cell, you will see the cell with black border around it.  This tells you that the cell is active.  Therefore, when you click into a cell, you can then type text and numbers.</p>
<h4>Specifying a Range of Cells</h4>
<p>A range is defined as a block of cells.  It maybe a single cell, group of adjacent cells or the entire worksheet.  Range of cells is specified by highlighting a group of cells or typing the addressed of the range in the name box located in the formatting tool bar.
    To specify a range of cells: By highlighting adjacent cells
    <ul>
        <li><b>Method 1:- </b> Click on the cell in the top left corner of the range and drag to the bottom-right corner of the range.</li>
        <li><b>Method 2:- </b> Move the cursor to the top left corner of the range and hold down the shift key and use the arrow keys to move the bottom-right corner of the range.</li>
    </ul>
    By Typing range address this includes:-
    <ul>
        <li>Click inside the name box and type the range address e.g. B3:F14</li>
        <li>Press the (Enter) key.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Calculating with formulas in MS-Excel</h4>
<p>	One of the advantages of MS-Excel spreadsheet is the ability to perform calculations using formulas and built in functions.  MS-Excel can perform row and column totals, sum range of cells and use formulas to perform simple and complex calculations.</p>
<h4>Calculating with formulas</h4>
<p>Formulas are formed using the arithmetic operators that specify what operation to perform the operators are listed below.</p>
<h4>Arithmetic operators in MS-Excel</h4>
<p>Operator	Action	Ms-Excel	Mathematics
    ^	Raise to power	3^2	32
    /	Division	18/4	18÷4
    *	Multiplication	20*5	20*5
    -	Subtraction	81-31	81-31
    +	Addition 	45+10	45+10
    Formula in MS-Excel begins with an equal are.
    FORMULA	           MEANING                                           
    =D4*F8		            Multiplies the value in cell D4 by the value in cell F8
    =B6+C6+D6	            Sums the value in cells 86:C6 and D6
    =(C18/4)*10  	            Divides the value in cell C18 by 4 and multiply the result by 10
    =G12^3		            Raises the value in cell G12 to Power 3
    </p>
    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <p>	MS-Excel has many built functions to perform calculations such as summations, logarithm, average, and square root.  Like formulas, functions must begin with an equal (=) sign followed by the function name and range of cells in pair of brackets.  The range of cells in pair of brackets is called the argument. E.g.
        =SUM(B6:D6) sums all the values in the range of B6:D6 sum-function name (B6:D6)-Argument
        =AVG(G10:H15) calculates the average of the values in the range G10:H15
        =MAX(A1:C7) finds the maximum value in the range A1:C17
        
        The expression =SUM(B6:D6) is equivalent to =B6+C6+D6 some MS-Excel functions are listed below
        
        MS-Excel Built In Functions
        Function	Description	Example
        =SUM	Sum all the value in a range	=SUM(B1:F10)
        =AVG	Calculates the average of a range	=AVG (G10:H15)
        =MAX	Find the largest value in a range	=MAX (A1:C7)
        =SQRT	Calculates the square root of a number	=SQRT(B16)
        =MIN	Finds the smallest value in a range	=MIN(D1:F10)
        =LOG	Find the log (base 10 of a number)	=LOG(B16)
        
        To enter a function, this includes:-
            Place the cursor where you want to the result to appear, type in the function required.  The function must begin with an equal sign (=) followed by the function name and then the range of cells in pairs of brackets.
        Using Auto-Sum To Calculate Totals
            Auto-Sum is used to calculate the sum of values in rows and columns.  It cannot perform calculations other than summations.  Ʃ the Auto-Sum button.
        </p>
        <h4>COPYING FORMULAS, FUNCTION AND SUMS TO OTHER CELLS.</h4>
        <p>	In practical the =Sum function was typed for each time to find the total scores. This procedure is time consuming if you were to find the scores for many times.  This problems can be overcome by copying the formula or function to other cells.  Formula or function  is copied using one of the following methods. 
            <ul>
                <li>Copy and Paste commands in the edit menu</li>
                <li>Copy and Paste buttons on the total bar: or</li>
                <li>Fill handle (Auto fill) in the right-corner of the cursor</li>
            </ul>
            to copy a sum, formula or function.  This includes: 
            <ul>
                <li>click on the cell containing the sum, formula or function</li>
                <li>click on the copy button on the total bar.
                    (or selection the copy command from the edit menu) 
                    Select the range of cells to fill with the sum, formula or function.
                    </li>
                    <li>click on the Paste button on the tool bar.
                        (or select the Paste command from the edit menu)
                        </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>MS-EXCEL CHART</h4>
        <p>You can display data graphically in a chart.  It is linked to the worksheet data you created and updated when you change the worksheet data.  They can create chart from cells or ranges that are not next to one another.</p>
