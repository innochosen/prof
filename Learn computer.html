    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device, which accepts and stores data input, process the data input, and generates the output in a required format.
        A computer system has the three main components; <b>HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, </b> and <b>PEOPLEWARE</b>.
        </p>
        <img src="./Images/Desktop Computer.jpg" alt="" width="450px" height="300px" style="border: solid 7px black;">  <b>A Computer</b>
        <h2>Components of the Computer</h2>
        <p>The computer consists of two major components, they are <b>HARDWARE</b> and <b>SOFTWARE</b>.  This part works together for effective operation of the computer system for the facts, that none of the component can function without others.</p>
        <h2>Computer Software</h2>
        <p>Computer software is a set of programs and associated documentation and data.  This is in contrast to hardware, from which system is built and which actually performs the work examples: FireFox, Google Chrome, CorelDRAW etc.</p>
        <p>There are two types of software</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>System Software</li>
            <li>Application Software</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>System Software</h3>
        <p>The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself.  System software is generally prepared by the computer manufacturers.  These software products compromise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the hardware at a very basic level.  System software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users.</p>
        <p>Some examples of system software are Operating System,  Compliers, Interpreter, Assemblers, etc.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of some of the most important features of a system software <ul>
            <li>Close to the system</li>
            <li>Fast in speed</li>
            <li>Difficult to design</li>
            <li>Less Interactive</li>
            <li>Smaller in size</li>
            <li>Difficult to manipulate</li>
            <li>Generally written in low-level language</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Application Software</h3>
        <p>Application software are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment.  All software applications prepared in a computer lab can come under the category of Application software.</p>
